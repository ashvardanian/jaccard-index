She displaced  at deep load and had a crew of 681 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered by four Parsons steam turbines using steam generated by twenty-six Belleville boilers.

She carried a maximum of  of coal which allowed her to steam for  at a speed of .\",\"Diderots main battery consisted of four 305mm/45 Modèle 1906 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of twelve 240mm/50 Modèle 1902 guns in twin turrets, three on each side of the ship. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included sixteen  L/65 guns and ten  Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also armed with two submerged  torpedo tubes.

She was launched on 19 April 1909 and was completed on 1 August 1911. The ship was assigned to the First Division of the First Squadron (escadre) of the Mediterranean Fleet when she was commissioned. The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between Provence and Tunisia in May–June 1913 and the subsequent naval review conducted by the President of France, Raymond Poincaré on 7 June 1913. Afterwards, Diderot joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October–December 1913 and participated in the grand fleet exercise in the Mediterranean in May 1914.\"],[\"In early August 1914, the ship cruised the Strait of Sicily in an attempt to prevent the German battlecruiser  and the light cruiser  from breaking out to the West. On 16 August 1914 the combined Anglo-French Fleet under Admiral Auguste Boué de Lapeyrère, including Diderot, made a sweep of the Adriatic Sea. The Allied ships encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , escorted by the destroyer , blockading the coast of Montenegro. There were too many ships for Zenta to escape, so she remained behind to allow Ulan to get away and was sunk by gunfire during the Battle of Antivari off the coast of Bar, Montenegro. Diderot subsequently participated in a number of raids into the Adriatic later in the year and patrolled the Ionian Islands. From December 1914 through 1917, the ship participated in the distant blockade of the Straits of Otranto while based in Corfu. In May 1918, Diderot became flagship of the First Division of the Second Squadron and was transferred that month to Mudros with her sister ships,  and , to prevent Goeben from breaking out into the Mediterranean and remained there until the end of the war.\",\"After the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship participated in the early stage of the occupation of Constantinople from 12 November to 12 December. Diderot was based in Toulon throughout 1919 and was modernized in 1922–25 to improve her underwater protection. The ship became a training ship in 1927 and was condemned in on 17 March 1937; sold to M.

When World War I began in August 1914, she unsuccessfully searched for the German battlecruiser  and the light cruiser  in the Western and Central Mediterranean. Later that month, the ship participated in the Battle of Antivari in the Adriatic Sea and helped to sink an Austro-Hungarian protected cruiser. Condorcet spent most of the rest of the war blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to keep German, Austro-Hungarian and Turkish warships bottled up.\",\"After the war, she was modernized in 1923–1925 and subsequently became a training ship. In 1931, the ship was converted into an accommodation hulk. Condorcet was captured intact when the Germans occupied Vichy France in November 1942 and was used by them to house sailors of their navy (Kriegsmarine). She was badly damaged by Allied bombing in 1944, but was later raised and scrapped by 1949.\",\"Although the s were a significant improvement from the preceding , they were outclassed by the advent of the dreadnought well before they were completed.

The purpose of the company is to engage in the detection, identification, study and preservation of nautical archaeological and historic sites for scientific research, public education, and the advancement of technology. The organization also provides fieldwork and training experience in the field to students and the personnel and staff of various government, cultural and educational institutions.\",\"Among the goals for RPMNF is to assist Mediterranean countries with the location, identification, assessment, and research of their submerged cultural material so that these resources can be protected for future generations.  Accordingly, RPMNF projects are carried out in conjunction with host governments in the Mediterranean and serve to protect submerged archaeological sites and maritime heritage in association with UNESCO's efforts to preserve world heritage sites. RPMNF policy stipulates that all artifacts are under the jurisdiction of the host government at all times. The location and assessment of wreck sites, as well as site and artifact analysis, can benefit governments that RPMNF works with, as it provides cultural authorities pertinent information for protecting archaeological resources like living things.\",\"Over the past decade RPMNF has made advances in maritime archaeology of the littoral region of the Mediterranean. RPMNF's research vessel, the R/V Hercules, is a purpose-built maritime archaeological platform that has seafloor mapping and three-dimensional modeling capabilities for identification of submerged cultural material sites. The vessel is designed as a self-sufficient base for projects in moderately deep littoral waters, typically limited to 500 m.  These operations include remote sensing equipment such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and various multibeam systems, the deployment of ROVs, data and media processing and other research functions.  Hercules is equipped with a dynamic positioning system and advanced data processing capabilities, as well as deck space and lifting systems to transport and deploy survey equipment.  Potential sites are verified and documented with ROV investigation.  The ROV is employed for video and image documentation, sampling, artifact retrieval, and limited excavation of sites. The ROV is also employed for the excavation of deep-water sites; an excavation methodological process that RPMNF is helping to advance within the field of maritime archaeology.\",\"RPMNF research vessel R/V Hercules is Maltese flagged and based in Valletta, Malta during the winter months.  This research vessel can be deployed throughout the Mediterranean on a project basis.\",\"The foundation was established in 2001 by its president, George Robb, who was a director for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology.  As part of RPMNF's initial foundation, it was established as a supporting institute for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology  Early field work centered in Florida and select supporting projects in the Mediterranean.  In 2003, Dr. Jeff Royal became archaeological director, and took over as executive director in 2011, during which time RPMNF's focus has centered on the Mediterranean.  At the end of 2010, RPMNF entered into an agreement and is a supporting institute for the Program in Maritime Studies at East Carolina University.  RPMNF continues to grow its associations with Universities, individual scholars, students, and new countries around the Mediterranean.\",...,\"Olin Wellborn (June 18, 1843 – December 6, 1921) was a United States representative from Texas and a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.\",\"Born on June 18, 1843, in Cumming, Forsyth County, Georgia, Wellborn attended the common schools, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and graduated from Emory University in 1862.

In its turn, it triggered the creation of a series of Russian-style ballets on the Imperial scene. Simultaneously, the Moscow Imperial troupe developed a different style, combining classical European choreography with real Russian folk dance.\",\"In 1876, Sokolov re-staged the choreography of Saint-Léon in Moscow at the Bolshoi Theatre, using genuine Russian dances. This re-staging separated the two ways the ballet was performed - the classical dance in Saint Petersburg and the dance incorporated into the performance in Moscow. This eventually developed into two schools of Russian Ballet, which survived well into the 1930s. Subsequently, the Moscow school ceased to exist when a large number of Saint Petersburg dancers were moved to Moscow in the 1930s.\",\"A hundred years later, in 1960, the Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin created a new ballet on the same subject.\",\"Re-staging by Arthur Saint-Léon for the Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre, with Cesare Pugni revising his original score.
